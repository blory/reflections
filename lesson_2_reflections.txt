What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A hidden .git file is created. So that you can track all changes that you make.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
 What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary area where you can organize changes in a file
from the working directory to the repository. 
And it prepares files allowing you to commit files together at the sametime.
