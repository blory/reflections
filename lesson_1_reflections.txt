What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
	Pros, being able to go back to a previous point. Cons, Forgetting to save and unable to retreieve unsaved work.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while Google Docs treats it separately
	Multiple files are related, thus having to save them in one commit, compared to Google Docs, only a single file is being worked on.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	git log shows all commits and their unique ids
	git diff compares two commits, to see what change between old/new

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
